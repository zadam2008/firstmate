# Firstmate watcher.
# Classifies supervision wakes in bash. In normal mode it absorbs benign wakes
# and keeps blocking; it queues and exits only for actionable wakes.
# The no-verb signal and stale path is absorb-only-when-provably-working: a wake
# is absorbed only when the crew shows POSITIVE evidence it is still working (an
# actively-running no-mistakes step, or a backend busy signal), and surfaced
# otherwise, so a crew that finishes (or stops and waits) without a current
# working signal is never silently swallowed. While state/.afk exists, the daemon
# owns triage and this watcher queues and exits on every wake. Printed reason lines:
#   signal: <file>...      status/turn-end signals, surfaced when a listed status
#                          has a captain-relevant verb OR a no-verb signal's crew
#                          is not provably working, unless afk is active
#   stale: <window>        a provably-working stale is ALWAYS absorbed (with a wedge
#                          timer) regardless of what the status log says - an active
#                          run-step or busy pane outranks even a captain-relevant log
#                          line, since the crew's own log gets no new entry once
#                          firstmate hands it to a no-mistakes validation. Only when
#                          NOT provably working does the log's last line decide:
#                          terminal (captain-relevant) or non-terminal (no verb),
#                          both surfaced at once. A provably-working stale past the
#                          wedge threshold also surfaces, with an "escalation N"
#                          count in the reason; at FM_WEDGE_DEMAND_INSPECT_COUNT
#                          consecutive escalations on the SAME pane, the reason
#                          also carries a "demand-deep-inspection" marker so the
#                          wake payload itself, not just repetition, forces a
#                          closer look instead of another routine supervision
#                          resume. Unless afk is active.

# Always-on wake triage: most wakes during a long crew validation are benign (a

# than wake firstmate's LLM for each, this watcher classifies every wake in bash
# and ABSORBS the benign majority - it advances the suppression marker, logs to a
# debug log, and keeps blocking WITHOUT enqueuing or exiting. The no-verb signal
# / stale path is absorb-only-when-provably-working: such a wake is absorbed ONLY
# while the crew shows positive evidence it is still working (an actively-running
# no-mistakes step, or a busy pane, via crew_is_provably_working over
# fm-crew-state.sh); a crew that stopped its turn with no running pipeline and no
# busy pane is SURFACED, so a finish reported only through interactive pane menus
# (no done: status) is never swallowed. An ACTIONABLE wake (a captain-relevant
# signal, a no-verb signal whose crew is not provably working, any check, a stale
# pane whose crew is not provably working, a provably-working stale past the
# threshold, or anything unknown) is written to the durable queue and exits, which
# is what wakes the LLM through the background-task completion. The same classifier
