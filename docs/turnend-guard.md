# Primary turn-end supervision guard

This is the authoritative contract for the "no turn ends blind" primary guard referenced from AGENTS.md section 8.
The shared predicate lives in `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`.
Harness-specific tracked hook files only adapt each verified harness's real turn-end mechanism to that shared predicate.

## Gap Closed

`bin/fm-guard.sh` is pull-based: it warns whenever some other supervision script happens to run, and prints nothing otherwise.
The primary can otherwise end a turn after handling wakes without resuming supervision, then sit blind until another fleet command happens to run.
On 2026-07-04, that exact gap left a parked no-mistakes gate unwatched for about nine hours.

`bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh` closes the gap by checking the primary's own turn-end path.
When tasks are in flight and there is no live identity-matched watcher with a fresh beacon, a harness hook must either block the turn end or force a bounded follow-up turn that tells the primary to resume the session-start supervision protocol for its harness.

## Shared Predicate

The guard first scopes itself to the real primary checkout.
It is inert in secondmate homes because `.fm-secondmate-home` exists there.
It is inert in crewmate and scout worktrees because firstmate provisions them as linked git worktrees, where `git rev-parse --git-dir` differs from `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`.
It also requires `AGENTS.md`, `bin/`, and the effective state directory to exist.

For an in-scope primary checkout, it counts in-flight work from `state/*.meta`.
If no task is in flight, it exits silently.
If work is in flight, it requires `fm_watcher_healthy <state-dir> <watch-path> [grace-seconds] [home]` from `bin/fm-wake-lib.sh`.
That is the same identity-matched live lock and fresh beacon check used by `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`.
A stale beacon blocks even if a watcher pid is still live.
A fresh leftover beacon blocks if the watcher lock is missing, dead, or identity-mismatched.

`FM_STATE_OVERRIDE` wins over `FM_HOME/state`, and `FM_HOME` wins over repo-root `state/`.
`FM_GUARD_GRACE` controls the beacon freshness window and defaults to 300 seconds.
If `jq` is missing or hook stdin is empty, the guard fails open and exits 0 because it cannot safely read loop-guard fields.

## Harness Integrations

All verified primary harnesses have a tracked integration:

- `claude`: `.claude/settings.json` registers a `Stop` hook command anchored through `"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`.
- `codex`: `.codex/hooks.json` registers a `Stop` hook that reads the hook payload once, anchors the executable to the hook command process working directory, verifies that root is firstmate-shaped and hook-bearing, and pipes the original payload to that checkout's `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`.
- `opencode`: `.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-turnend-guard.js` listens for `session.idle`, lets the watcher-arm coordinator handle normal idle supervision first, runs the shared guard only when that coordinator does not act, and uses `client.session.promptAsync` to force one follow-up prompt when the guard returns 2.
- `pi`: `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts` listens for `turn_end`, marks the extension version loaded for session-start checks, runs the shared guard, and uses `pi.sendUserMessage(..., { deliverAs: "followUp" })` to force one follow-up prompt when the guard returns 2.
- `grok`: `.grok/hooks/fm-primary-turnend-guard.json` registers a `Stop` hook that invokes `bin/fm-turnend-guard-grok.sh`.
  The adapter runs the shared guard and, when it returns 2, invokes `grok --resume <sessionId> -p <guard-reason>` with `GROK_TURNEND_GUARD_ACTIVE=1`.
  It does not pass `--permission-mode`, so the passive Stop hook cannot grant stronger tool permissions than Grok's resumed-session default.

Claude and Codex support a direct blocking Stop hook.
For those harnesses, exit status 2 plus stderr from `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh` blocks the stop and feeds the reason back into the model.
Both payloads include `stop_hook_active`; when it is true, the shared guard exits 0 so the harness can end after one forced continuation.

OpenCode, Pi, and Grok expose passive turn-end events for this purpose.
Their adapters fail open at the hook boundary to avoid corrupting a user session, but they force one follow-up turn when the shared predicate blocks.
Each adapter carries its own in-process or environment loop guard so the forced follow-up does not recursively schedule another follow-up.
If a passive adapter cannot call its SDK method, cannot find `grok`, or cannot recover the Grok session id, it fails open and relies on the pull-based `fm-guard.sh` warning at the next fleet command.
That warning uses `bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh --repair-line`, so it points back to the active harness protocol instead of hardcoding one background-arm command.

## Empirical Validation

All harnesses were validated on 2026-07-08 in scratch repos or throwaway homes, not against the captain's live primary fleet state.

Claude Code 2.1.204 preserved the existing behavior.
Hook file used: `.claude/settings.json`.
Command run: `claude -p "Say hi in exactly one word." --dangerously-skip-permissions --output-format json` with a scratch Stop hook that printed `SMOKETEST: you must say the word BANANA before stopping` and exited 2.
Observed output: the first stop payload had `stop_hook_active=false`, the stop was blocked, the model continued with `BANANA`, and the second stop payload had `stop_hook_active=true` and was allowed.
Earlier validation on 2026-07-04 also verified that `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is set to the settings-loaded project root, while the hook command itself runs from the session cwd.

Codex `codex-cli 0.142.1` was validated with a scratch `.codex/hooks.json` Stop hook.
Hook file used: `.codex/hooks.json`.
Command run: `codex exec --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --skip-git-repo-check --output-last-message last.txt 'Say hi in exactly one word.'`.
Observed output: the first model output was `Hi`, the Stop hook exited 2, Codex logged `hook: Stop Blocked`, the model continued with `CODEXHOOK`, and the second hook call had `stop_hook_active=true`.
The Stop payload included `cwd`.
Command run for root-signal probe: `codex exec --ephemeral --json --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --skip-git-repo-check --output-last-message last.txt 'Use the shell tool to run mkdir -p outside && cd outside && pwd, then use the shell tool again to run pwd. Your final answer must include the two observed outputs.'`.
Observed output: the first command printed `<scratch>/outside`, the second command printed `<scratch>`, the Stop hook process `pwd -P` printed `<scratch>`, payload `cwd` printed `<scratch>`, and `CODEX_PROJECT_DIR`, `CODEX_WORKSPACE_ROOT`, and `CODEX_CWD` were empty.
The tracked command therefore treats hook process PWD as the hook-loaded firstmate root and does not let payload `cwd` choose an executable.
It still passes the original payload to `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`, so the shared loop guard reads `stop_hook_active`.

OpenCode 1.17.6 was validated with project plugins under scratch `.opencode/plugins/`.
Hook file used: `.opencode/plugins/fm-smoke.js` for throw testing and `.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-turnend-guard.js` for follow-up testing.
Command run for passive behavior: `opencode run --print-logs --log-level DEBUG --dangerously-skip-permissions 'Say hi in exactly one word.'`.
Observed output: the plugin received `session.idle`, threw an error, and `opencode run` still exited 0 with `Hi`, proving `session.idle` cannot block directly.
Command run for follow-up behavior: `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT='{"permission":{"*":"allow"}}' opencode --prompt 'Say hi in exactly one word.' --print-logs --log-level INFO`.
Observed output: the plugin called `client.session.promptAsync`, the TUI ran a second turn, and the second model output contained `OPENCODEHOOK`.
In noninteractive `opencode run`, `promptAsync` returned successfully but the process exited before displaying the follow-up, so this adapter is trusted for primary TUI sessions and documented as passive/fail-open in headless mode.

Pi 0.80.2 was validated with a scratch extension.
Hook file used: a scratch `ext.ts` matching `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts`.
Command run: `pi -p -e "$scratch/ext.ts" --no-context-files --no-session 'Say hi in exactly one word.'`.
Observed output: the extension received `turn_end`, `pi.sendUserMessage` without `deliverAs` errored with `Agent is already processing`, and `pi.sendUserMessage(..., { deliverAs: "followUp" })` queued the follow-up successfully.
The second model output contained `PIHOOK`, and the next `turn_end` was skipped by the extension's loop guard.

Grok 0.2.91 was validated with a scratch `GROK_HOME` and symlinked auth/config.
Hook file used for tracked project-hook loading: `<scratch-project>/.grok/hooks/fm-smoke.json`, matching the tracked `.grok/hooks/fm-primary-turnend-guard.json` location.
Command run for project-hook loading: `GROK_HOME="$scratch/grok-home" grok --trust -p 'Say hi in exactly one word.' --permission-mode bypassPermissions --output-format plain --leader-socket "$scratch/leader.sock"`.
Observed output: the project Stop hook fired under `--trust` and received `GROK_HOOK_EVENT=stop`, `GROK_WORKSPACE_ROOT`, and a payload containing `sessionId`.
Hook file used for passive behavior and forced-resume behavior: `$GROK_HOME/hooks/fm-primary-turnend-guard.json` plus `bin/fm-turnend-guard-grok.sh`.
Command run for passive behavior: `GROK_HOME="$scratch/grok-home" grok -p 'Say hi in exactly one word.' --permission-mode bypassPermissions --output-format plain --leader-socket "$scratch/leader.sock"`.
Observed output: the global Stop hook fired and received `GROK_HOOK_EVENT=stop`, `GROK_WORKSPACE_ROOT`, and a payload containing `sessionId`, but exiting 2 did not make the model continue.
Command run for forced resume behavior: the Stop hook ran `GROK_TURNEND_GUARD_ACTIVE=1 GROK_HOME="$scratch/grok-home" grok --resume "$session_id" -p 'SMOKETEST: say exactly GROKRESUMEHOOK...' --permission-mode bypassPermissions --output-format plain --leader-socket "$scratch/leader.sock"`.
Observed output: the outer turn printed `Hi`, the nested resumed turn printed `GROKRESUMEHOOK`, and the nested Stop hook saw `GROK_TURNEND_GUARD_ACTIVE=1` and did not recurse.
That validation command used `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` only to keep the scratch smoke unattended; the tracked adapter intentionally omits `--permission-mode`.
Project-local Grok hooks did not fire in scratch single mode without a trust grant.
The primary integration therefore requires the primary firstmate checkout to be trusted for Grok hooks, which can be done with `/hooks-trust` or launch-time `--trust`.
If Grok declines to load project hooks, this primary guard fails open and `fm-guard.sh` remains the next-command alarm.

## Tests

`tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh` covers the shared predicate, primary scoping, `FM_HOME` and `FM_STATE_OVERRIDE` precedence, loop-safety, fail-open behavior without `jq`, tracked hook registration for all five harnesses, and the Grok adapter's forced-resume loop guard and permission-mode regression.
These tests do not invoke live harnesses.
Live harness validation is the empirical evidence recorded above.
