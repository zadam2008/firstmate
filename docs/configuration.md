# Configuration

The files and environment variables you set to operate firstmate.

## Orchestrator behavior (AGENTS.md)

The shared orchestrator behavior lives in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) - edit it like any prompt when the fleet is empty, or dispatch shared-repo edits to a crewmate while tasks are in flight.

## Backlog backend (.tasks.toml / config/backlog-backend)

The tracked `.tasks.toml` pins the default `tasks-axi` markdown backend to `data/backlog.md`, with `done_keep = 10` and an archive at `data/done-archive.md`.
When the default backend is selected and compatible `tasks-axi` is on `PATH`, firstmate uses its verbs for routine backlog mutations.
Secondmate handoffs are separate and unconditional: `fm-backlog-handoff.sh` keeps only its own fleet-level validation and always delegates the item move to `tasks-axi mv`, the single owner of the backlog format.
It moves in-scope `## Queued` items only and refuses `## In flight` and historical `## Done` records, which stay with their home for pruning or archiving.
Handoff item bodies must use at least two leading spaces, and the helper refuses a selected item with a single-space or tab-indented continuation rather than risk orphaning it.
Because bootstrap requires `tasks-axi` on `PATH` on every profile, that delegation works fleet-wide, and the `config/backlog-backend=manual` knob governs firstmate's own hand-editing of its backlog, not this validated helper.
Compatible means the shared bootstrap probe accepts `tasks-axi --version` as 0.1.1 or newer, `tasks-axi update --help` exposes `--archive-body`, and `tasks-axi mv --help` exposes `[<id>...]` for the atomic multi-ID move introduced in 0.2.2 and required by handoff delegation.
That sentence is the single owner of the tasks-axi compatibility definition; every other document points here instead of restating the version gates.
Bootstrap requires compatible `tasks-axi` on every profile; see "Toolchain" below for missing-tool reporting and `TASKS_AXI: available` behavior.
Set the local, gitignored `config/backlog-backend` file to `manual` to force manual backlog editing and suppress `TASKS_AXI: available`, not missing-tool reporting.
Absent or `tasks-axi` selects the default tasks-axi backend.
The file format is unchanged in both modes; tasks-axi and manual edits produce the same `## In flight`, `## Queued`, and `## Done` sections.

## Runtime backend (config/backend / FM_BACKEND)

For spawn-capable adapters, the runtime session-provider backend controls where task windows/endpoints are created, captured, sent to, watched, and killed.
`tmux` is the verified reference backend (see [`docs/tmux-backend.md`](tmux-backend.md)); `herdr`, `zellij`, `orca`, and `cmux` are experimental spawn backends (see [`docs/herdr-backend.md`](herdr-backend.md), [`docs/zellij-backend.md`](zellij-backend.md), [`docs/orca-backend.md`](orca-backend.md), and [`docs/cmux-backend.md`](cmux-backend.md)).
Treehouse remains the worktree provider for tmux, herdr, zellij, and cmux, since herdr, zellij, and cmux are session providers only; Orca provides both the task worktree and terminal endpoint.
New spawns choose the backend in this order: an explicit `--backend` flag firstmate passes when it spawns a task, then `FM_BACKEND`, then the first non-empty line of local gitignored `config/backend`, then runtime auto-detection from `$TMUX`, `HERDR_ENV=1`, or cmux runtime signals, then default `tmux`.
If more than one runtime marker is present, detection resolves innermost-first: `$TMUX` is checked before `HERDR_ENV=1`, which is checked before cmux's primary `CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID` marker and its documented fallback signals - tmux or herdr started from inside a cmux terminal is the innermost, currently-executing layer, while cmux itself (a terminal application, not a nestable multiplexer) is always checked last.
See [`docs/cmux-backend.md`](cmux-backend.md#runtime-auto-detection) for why cmux can be selected when `CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID` is absent.
Auto-detected herdr or cmux prints a stderr notice naming `config/backend` and `--backend tmux` as opt-outs; auto-detected tmux stays silent to preserve existing default behavior.
Zellij and Orca are never auto-detected; select them by putting the name in a local `config/backend` file, by exporting `FM_BACKEND=<name>`, or by telling the first mate in chat.
Any value other than `tmux`, `herdr`, `zellij`, `orca`, or `cmux` is rejected until another adapter is implemented and verified.
`fm-spawn.sh` accepts `tmux`, `herdr`, `zellij`, `orca`, and `cmux` for ship and scout tasks; `backend=orca` and `backend=cmux` both still refuse `--secondmate` until secondmate launch semantics are designed for each.
`codex-app` is not an accepted runtime backend yet; [`docs/codex-app-backend.md`](codex-app-backend.md) owns the Codex App boundary.
The session-start secondmate liveness sweep uses a deeper `fm_backend_agent_alive` probe where verified.
Today that probe can classify tmux and herdr secondmate endpoints as `alive`, `dead`, or `unknown`; zellij, Orca, and cmux report `unknown` until their own agent-process classifiers are verified.
A herdr spawn additionally version-gates against the installed `herdr` binary's protocol and requires `jq`, refusing loudly on an incompatible or missing installation.
A zellij spawn additionally version-gates against the installed `zellij` binary's version and requires `jq`, refusing loudly when either is missing or the version is older than 0.44.
A cmux spawn additionally version-gates against the installed `cmux` binary's version, requires `jq`, and requires the control socket to be reachable and accessible (see [`docs/cmux-backend.md`](cmux-backend.md) "Setup" for the one-time socket-access configuration this needs; Automation mode is the recommended socket control mode, with Password mode supported via `config/cmux-socket-password`), refusing loudly and non-retryably on a `cmuxOnly`/unauthenticated socket.
A backend spawn refusal from a missing dependency, version gate, or unauthenticated socket is terminal for that selected backend; firstmate surfaces it as a blocker instead of silently retrying another backend.
Task meta records `backend=` only for a non-default backend; an absent `backend=` means `tmux`, preserving existing default-path meta files.
A herdr task additionally records `herdr_session=`, `herdr_workspace_id=`, `herdr_tab_id=`, and `herdr_pane_id=`.
A zellij task additionally records `zellij_session=`, `zellij_tab_id=`, and `zellij_pane_id=`.
An Orca task additionally records `orca_worktree_id=` and `terminal=`, with `window=fm-<id>` kept as the shared firstmate alias.
A cmux task additionally records `cmux_workspace_id=` and `cmux_surface_id=`.
Task selectors for `fm-peek.sh`, `fm-send.sh`, and `fm-crew-state.sh` resolve centrally through `fm_backend_resolve_selector`.
A selector containing `:` is passed through as an explicit backend endpoint escape hatch.
Otherwise an exact task id matching `state/<id>.meta` wins before the legacy `fm-<id>` label fallback, so task ids that themselves start with `fm-` route to their own metadata instead of being stripped.
A metadata-routed selector returns the recorded backend target (`terminal=` for Orca, otherwise `window=`), and matching explicit targets can still recover the recorded backend when metadata contains the same endpoint.
Only metadata-routed task selectors carry secondmate-marker and Codex-harness context; explicit endpoint escape hatches do not.
These five sentences are the single owner of the task-selector vocabulary; backend guides and other documents point here instead of restating the resolution order.
`fm-teardown.sh <id>` takes a task id directly and uses the same recorded backend target fields after loading `state/<id>.meta`.
Herdr workspaces are derived from `FM_HOME`: the primary home uses `firstmate`, and a secondmate home marked by `.fm-secondmate-home` uses `2ndmate-<secondmate-id>`.
Spawn, list-live, and recovery paths read that label from the active home, so a secondmate's own crewmates stay inside that secondmate home's herdr space.
For normal herdr operations, `HERDR_SESSION` selects the named session, but destructive test cleanup must not rely on `HERDR_SESSION` alone.
Use the explicit guarded cleanup path described in [`docs/herdr-backend.md`](herdr-backend.md) instead of `herdr server stop`.
For normal zellij operations, `FM_ZELLIJ_SESSION` selects the named session and defaults to `firstmate`.
Zellij has no per-home workspace split: primary and secondmate tasks share that one session, and visible tab titles are scoped by the active `FM_HOME` readable label plus a short hash of the resolved `FM_ROOT` path as `fm-<home-label>-<id>`.
Use the guarded cleanup path described in [`docs/zellij-backend.md`](zellij-backend.md) instead of `kill-all-sessions` or `delete-all-sessions`.
cmux has no session layer at all - one workspace per task, in whatever cmux window is open - and its socket password (when configured) is read from local, gitignored `config/cmux-socket-password` under the effective config directory, never committed.
The caller-facing label remains `fm-<id>`, but the actual cmux workspace title is scoped by the active `FM_HOME` readable label plus a short hash of the resolved `FM_ROOT` path as `fm-<home-label>-<id>`.
Test cleanup must use the guarded path described in [`docs/cmux-backend.md`](cmux-backend.md)'s "Test safety" section, never enumerate-and-close every workspace.
The `config/backend` file is not inherited by secondmate homes.

## Away-mode supervisor backend (FM_SUPERVISOR_BACKEND / FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET)

The `/afk` sub-supervisor injects escalation digests into firstmate's own pane independently of where new task endpoints are spawned.
It currently supports only `tmux` and `herdr` supervisor panes.
Set `FM_SUPERVISOR_BACKEND=tmux|herdr` and `FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET=<target>` to override both axes explicitly; for herdr the target is `"<session>:<pane-id>"`.
Without overrides, backend detection uses `$TMUX_PANE` first, then `HERDR_ENV=1` with `HERDR_PANE_ID`, then falls back to `tmux`.
That keeps a tmux pane nested inside herdr on the tmux transport, matching the runtime backend's innermost-first rule.
Target detection uses `FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET`, then `$TMUX_PANE`, then `"${HERDR_SESSION:-default}:${HERDR_PANE_ID}"` under herdr, then the legacy `firstmate:0` tmux fallback with a warning.
Selecting any other supervisor backend, including `zellij`, `orca`, or `cmux`, refuses at daemon startup instead of trying tmux injection primitives against a non-tmux pane.

## Away-mode wedge alarm channels (config/wedge-alarm)

When away-mode injection wedges past `FM_MAX_DEFER_SECS`, the sub-supervisor raises a loud, rate-limited alarm.
Beyond the durable `state/.subsuper-inject-wedged` marker and the tmux status-line flash, it attempts a configured backend-independent active alert that can reach the captain even when every pane and its backend status-line is unreadable.
`config/wedge-alarm` (local, gitignored) lists channel directives, one per non-empty, non-comment line; every listed non-`off` channel fires, best-effort.
`FM_WEDGE_ALARM_CHANNEL` overrides the file with a single directive.
Directives are `off` (a position-independent kill switch that disables every active alert), `auto`/`default`, `osascript` (macOS Notification Center banner), `herdr` (herdr UI notification), and `command:<cmd>` (run `<cmd>` via `sh -c`, summary on `$1` and stdin).
An absent file means `auto`, i.e. default-on on macOS: the alarm exists precisely so a wedged away-mode primary is never silent, and it fires at most once per max-defer window after a genuine wedge.
A missing or failing channel logs and falls through to the next, never crashing the daemon.
See [`wedge-alarm.md`](wedge-alarm.md) for the channel reference and macOS verification evidence, and [`examples/wedge-alarm`](examples/wedge-alarm) for a copyable config.

## Gate defaults (.no-mistakes.yaml)

The tracked `.no-mistakes.yaml` keeps test evidence outside the repo and defines `commands.test` so no-mistakes runs firstmate's bash behavior suite directly.
That evidence policy is specific to the firstmate repo: target projects may legitimately commit `.no-mistakes/evidence/` from their own no-mistakes pipeline, but firstmate keeps `.no-mistakes/` local and CI rejects tracked entries under that path.
That command requires `tmux` on `PATH`, prints `tmux -V`, runs every `tests/*.test.sh` with `bash`, and fails if any script exits non-zero.
It intentionally mirrors the behavior-test baseline in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) instead of delegating the test step to an agent.

## Captain preferences (data/captain.md)

Personal preferences for one captain's fleet live locally in `data/captain.md`; it is gitignored and printed in the session-start context digest after `data/projects.md` and optional `data/secondmates.md`.
Before changing it, inspect the current file and rewrite or prune the matching bullet in place; add a new bullet only for a genuinely new durable preference.

## Operational learnings (data/learnings.md)

Fleet-local operational facts and gotchas live locally in `data/learnings.md`; it is gitignored and printed right after `data/captain.md` in the session-start context digest.
The file is created lazily on first learning and follows the same dated, evidence-backed, curated style as `data/captain.md`: inspect the current file first, then rewrite or prune stale entries instead of appending forever.

## Secondmate routes (data/secondmates.md)

Persistent secondmate routes live locally in `data/secondmates.md`.
Each line records the secondmate id, charter summary, absolute home path, natural-language scope, project clone list, and added date; `fm-home-seed.sh validate` refuses duplicate ids, duplicate homes, and nested or overlapping homes.
The main first mate routes by reading those scopes with judgment; the project list is provisioning data, not exclusive ownership.
Use `fm-home-seed.sh <id> - {<project>...|--no-projects}` to lease a fresh firstmate worktree for the secondmate home.
Use the deliberate `--no-projects` signal only for a firstmate-repo domain that needs no separate project clones.
It cannot be combined with a project list, and omitting both still fails loudly.
A project-less seed requires no existing project clones or `data/projects.md` entries in the home, so it refuses a populated-home conversion without changing that home.
A preexisting project-bearing charter is also refused until it is re-scaffolded with `--no-projects` or removed.
The lease is held under the secondmate id until explicit retirement or seed rollback returns it, so normal restarts do not free or recycle the home.
Teardown of a leased home fails closed if `treehouse return` cannot release the lease; plain-clone homes with no treehouse pool slot are removed directly.
Secondmate routes cover `no-mistakes` and `direct-PR` projects; `local-only` projects remain main-firstmate work.
For `no-mistakes` projects, seeding initializes only projects newly cloned into a secondmate home and refuses to mutate a preexisting clone that is not already initialized.
After creating a secondmate, move existing main-backlog queued items that you have judged in-scope with `fm-backlog-handoff.sh <secondmate-id> <item-key>...`; it is idempotent and refuses In flight, Done, or non-secondmate homes.
Set `FM_SECONDMATE_CHARTER` to seed from inline charter text when no filled charter brief exists; set `FM_SECONDMATE_SCOPE` when the routing scope should differ from the charter text.
Each seed writes an `.fm-secondmate-home` identity marker at the home root.
The tracked root `.gitignore` ignores that marker, so validation can read it without making a freshly seeded home appear dirty to porcelain-based safety checks.
This does not relax protection for any other untracked file.
An existing linked-worktree home that predates this rule advances through its marker-only state during its next bootstrap or spawn local sync, after which Git ignores the marker normally.
A standalone-clone home cannot receive a primary-local commit through that no-fetch sync, so it receives the rule through `/updatefirstmate`'s origin refresh instead.

## FM_HOME

`FM_HOME` selects the operational home for one firstmate instance.
When it is unset, most scripts use the repo root as the home; when it is set, scripts still run from this repo's `bin/`, but `state/`, `data/`, `config/`, and `projects/` come from `$FM_HOME`.
`FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE` overrides the firstmate repo root used by scripts, including the primary checkout watched by the worktree-tangle guard.
When `FM_HOME` is unset, it also behaves as the old whole-root override.
`bin/fm-send.sh` is intentionally stricter than that general fallback: it requires `FM_HOME` to be set before resolving a target, so operator steers cannot silently resolve against the wrong home.
`FM_STATE_OVERRIDE`, `FM_DATA_OVERRIDE`, `FM_PROJECTS_OVERRIDE`, and `FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE` override individual operational directories for tests and specialized harness setup.
For the herdr backend, `FM_HOME` also determines the workspace label used by the adapter.
For the zellij backend, `FM_HOME` does not split containers, but it determines the readable home prefix embedded in visible tab titles; use `FM_ZELLIJ_SESSION` when a separate zellij session is needed.
The full zellij home label also includes a short hash of the resolved `FM_ROOT` path.
For the cmux backend, `FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE` overrides where `config/cmux-socket-password` is read from, while `FM_HOME` determines the default config path and readable home prefix embedded in workspace titles.
The full cmux home label also includes a short hash of the resolved `FM_ROOT` path, and there is no per-home container split.

## Harness support

claude, codex, opencode, pi, and grok are all empirically verified; new harnesses get verified through a supervised trial task before joining the set.
The verified adapter knowledge - busy signatures, interrupt and exit commands, skill-invocation syntax, and per-harness quirks - lives in [`.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md`](../.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md).
Launch mechanics, including the verified command templates, live in [`bin/fm-spawn.sh`](../bin/fm-spawn.sh).
Primary-session turn-end guard integrations for verified harnesses are tracked as repo-level hook files and documented in [`docs/turnend-guard.md`](turnend-guard.md).
Primary-session watcher wake protocols are rendered at session start by [`bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh`](../bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh) from [`docs/supervision-protocols/`](supervision-protocols/).
Claude and Grok use background-notify cycles, Codex uses bounded foreground checkpoints, Pi uses its two tracked primary extensions, and OpenCode uses its TUI plugin.
`config/crew-harness` is a local, gitignored file containing one adapter name for crewmate and scout launches.
When it is absent or contains `default`, crewmates mirror the firstmate's own harness.
`config/secondmate-harness` is a separate local, gitignored file containing the adapter the primary uses to launch secondmate agents, optionally followed by model and effort tokens on the same line.
The first non-empty, non-comment line is parsed as `<harness> [<model>] [<effort>]`.
A bare `<harness>` preserves the previous behavior: harness only, with no model or effort launch flag.
When the harness token is absent or `default`, secondmate launch falls back through `config/crew-harness` and then the primary's own harness, and no model or effort is read from that file.
`fm-harness.sh secondmate-model` and `fm-harness.sh secondmate-effort` expose only the optional tokens from `config/secondmate-harness`; `config/crew-harness` remains a bare adapter-name file.
An explicit harness argument to `fm-spawn.sh` still overrides either config file for that spawn only.
An explicit `--model` or `--effort` overrides the matching token from `config/secondmate-harness`; an explicit harness or raw launch command starts with clean model and effort defaults unless those flags are also passed.
When `config/crew-dispatch.json` exists, crewmate and scout spawns require an explicit resolved harness instead of automatically falling back to `config/crew-harness`.
The primary propagates `config/crew-dispatch.json`, `config/crew-harness`, and `config/backlog-backend` into secondmate homes at secondmate spawn, during the locked session-start bootstrap secondmate sweep, and during explicit `bin/fm-config-push.sh` runs, so a secondmate's own crewmates, dispatch profiles, and backlog backend use the primary values.
`config/secondmate-harness` is not inherited because secondmates do not launch secondmates.
For grok, `fm-spawn.sh` installs one firstmate-owned global turn-end hook under `$GROK_HOME/hooks/`, or `~/.grok/hooks/` when `GROK_HOME` is unset, and drops a per-task `.fm-grok-turnend` pointer in the worktree, with teardown removing the task token and pointer.
For Pi secondmate launches, `fm-spawn.sh` starts Pi with `-e` pointed at the secondmate home's own tracked `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts` and `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts`, both already present from the secondmate home's git worktree.

## Crew dispatch profiles (config/crew-dispatch.json)

`config/crew-dispatch.json` is an optional local, gitignored file containing natural-language rules that firstmate reads before dispatching a crewmate or scout.
The shell scripts do not match those rules; firstmate chooses the best matching rule with judgment, resolves that rule directly or through a supported selector, and passes only concrete `--harness`, `--model`, and `--effort` flags to `fm-spawn.sh`.
When the file exists, `fm-spawn.sh` enforces that contract by refusing crewmate and scout spawns that lack an explicit harness (`--harness`, a positional adapter, or a raw launch command).
Batch spawns satisfy the same requirement with a shared `--harness`.
Secondmate spawns are exempt and still resolve through `config/secondmate-harness` and its optional model and effort tokens.
This section is the single owner of the canonical schema and its per-field semantics; `AGENTS.md` section 4 keeps only the dispatch procedure and points here.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "when": "<natural-language condition describing a kind of task>",
      "use": [
        { "harness": "<adapter>", "model": "<optional model>", "effort": "<low|medium|high|xhigh|max, optional>" }
      ],
      "select": "<optional strategy>",
      "why": "<optional rationale that helps firstmate choose>"
    }
  ],
  "default": { "harness": "<adapter>", "model": "<optional model>", "effort": "<optional effort>" }
}
```

Per rule, `when` and `use` are required.
`use` may be a single profile object or an ordered array of profile objects; the single-object form stays fully backward-compatible, and every profile needs `harness`.
`use.model`, `use.effort`, and `why` are optional.
`select` is optional and currently supports `quota-balanced`.
Absent `select` means use the first array element, or the only object in the single-object form; the first array element is the deterministic tie-break and the ultimate fallback.
`default` is optional.
An omitted model or effort means the selected harness uses its own default for that axis.
If a selected profile carries an effort value the chosen harness does not accept, `fm-spawn.sh` records the requested `effort=` in task meta for traceability but omits the launch flag, and bootstrap reports the invalid harness/effort pair as a `CREW_DISPATCH` diagnostic when it is visible in the file.
`quota-balanced` selection is deterministic and implemented by `bin/fm-dispatch-select.sh`, whose header owns the general-window rules, the 20 point stale-clear freshness margin, vendor-availability handling, and the degrade-to-first-element fallbacks; quota trouble never blocks dispatch.
See [`docs/examples/crew-dispatch.json`](examples/crew-dispatch.json) for a starting point to copy into local `config/crew-dispatch.json`.
When the file exists, bootstrap validates it with `jq`.
Valid files produce a `CREW_DISPATCH: active config/crew-dispatch.json` block that lists each rule and prints `default:` when present.
Malformed JSON, an unverified harness, a malformed array profile, an unknown `select`, or an effort value unsupported by that harness is reported as `CREW_DISPATCH: invalid config/crew-dispatch.json - ...`; missing `jq` is reported through the normal `MISSING: jq` install-consent flow.
If no dispatch rule fits, firstmate uses the dispatch profile `default` when present, then falls back to `config/crew-harness`.
Because the spawn backstop is gated by file presence, any fallback path after a missing match, validation error, or missing `jq` still passes a resolved harness explicitly until the file is fixed or removed.
Secondmate homes inherit this file from the primary, so a secondmate's own crewmates apply the same dispatch profile behavior.

## Toolchain

On session start the first mate detects what its required toolchain is missing or too old (tmux, node, git, gh with GitHub auth via `gh auth login`, treehouse with durable lease support, no-mistakes v1.31.2 or newer, gh-axi, chrome-devtools-axi, lavish-axi, compatible tasks-axi per "Backlog backend" above, and quota-axi), lists it with the exact install commands, and installs only after you say go.
This section is the single owner of that universal toolchain list; backend guides' prerequisites point here and add only their backend-specific tools.
In that list, treehouse pools clean task worktrees, no-mistakes runs the validation pipeline, gh-axi, chrome-devtools-axi, and lavish-axi cover GitHub, browser, and rich-review operations, and tasks-axi plus quota-axi back backlog mutations and quota-balanced dispatch.
When bootstrap resolves `backend=orca` from `FM_BACKEND` or `config/backend`, it requires `orca`, keeps the universal `node` requirement, and skips `tmux` and `treehouse`.
When `config/crew-dispatch.json` exists, bootstrap also requires `jq` for dispatch profile validation.
When X mode is opted in, bootstrap also requires `curl` and `jq` before arming the relay poll shim.
`tasks-axi` and `quota-axi` are required bootstrap tools in every profile, the same class as `lavish-axi`.
An absent or incompatible `tasks-axi` reports `MISSING: tasks-axi (install: npm install -g tasks-axi)`; when `config/backlog-backend` is not `manual` and compatible `tasks-axi` is on `PATH`, bootstrap also prints `TASKS_AXI: available` and firstmate uses its verbs for routine backlog mutations, otherwise it hand-edits `data/backlog.md` until installation is approved and completed.
An absent `quota-axi` reports `MISSING: quota-axi (install: npm install -g quota-axi)`; `bin/fm-dispatch-select.sh` still degrades to the first profile at runtime when quota data is unavailable.
Bootstrap also reports a `TANGLE:` line when `FM_ROOT` is on a named non-default branch; follow the printed checkout remediation rather than treating it as an installable tool problem.
In a read-only session that did not get the fleet lock, the same line is advisory and omits the checkout command.
The locked session-start bootstrap step also runs a best-effort project clone refresh through `fm-fleet-sync.sh`.
It emits `FLEET_SYNC:` for skipped refreshes that may matter, recovered self-heals, and `STUCK:` alarms.
Normal completed runs keep local-only and no-origin skips silent.
If bootstrap kills a timed-out refresh, it replays any completed `fm-fleet-sync.sh` output before the aggregate timeout skip so no finished result is lost.
A killed refresh (or a teardown process kill) can leave an orphaned `.git/packed-refs.lock` in a clone, which makes the next refresh's fetch fail with Git's `Unable to create '...packed-refs.lock': File exists`.
On that signature only, `fm-fleet-sync.sh` retries the fetch with a bounded wait for the lock to self-clear, then removes the lock and retries once more only when it can prove the lock stale, exactly like the `fm-teardown.sh` `index.lock` recovery.
It never removes a live lock, leaves any other failure shape untouched, and prints every wait, retry, and removal to stderr plus a one-line `recovered:` summary to stdout on success so that this session-start relay still surfaces the recovery.
The locked session-start bootstrap step also runs the guarded local secondmate sync for recorded live secondmate homes, then propagates declared inheritable local config into each validated live home.
It emits `SECONDMATE_SYNC:` only when a home was skipped for an actionable sync reason or config inheritance failed, and `NUDGE_SECONDMATES:` only when a running home advanced and its instruction surface (`AGENTS.md`, `bin/`, or `.agents/skills/`) changed.
`NUDGE_SECONDMATES:` lists stable `fm-<id>` task selectors; the `bootstrap-diagnostics` skill owns the send procedure.
The same bootstrap run also emits `SECONDMATE_LIVENESS:` for live secondmate endpoints: `already-live` and `respawned` are handled states, while `skipped` or `respawn failed` means the secondmate still needs attention.
For a mid-session inherited config edit where tracked-file sync and reread nudges are not needed, run `bin/fm-config-push.sh`.
It uses the same live secondmate discovery and propagation helper as bootstrap, prints each live home's `crew-dispatch.json`, `crew-harness`, and `backlog-backend` result as `pushed`, `unchanged`, `skipped`, or `error`, and exits non-zero only for real propagation errors.
That live discovery starts from `state/*.meta` records with `kind=secondmate`; `data/secondmates.md` only backfills `home=` for older or incomplete meta records.
Skipped items, such as a destination checkout that does not yet gitignore the item, are visible warnings but not hard failures.

## X mode (.env)

X mode lets a firstmate instance answer public `@myfirstmate` mentions and act on normal reversible mention requests through firstmate's normal lifecycle.
It is off unless the firstmate home's gitignored `.env` contains a non-empty `FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN`.
The pairing token both identifies the relay tenant and records opt-in consent for autonomous public replies and eligible lifecycle actions.
Destructive, irreversible, or security-sensitive asks are flagged for trusted-channel confirmation instead of being executed from a public mention.
The relay uses owner-only routing: a mention delivered to a home is from that home's owner/captain, while parent-thread context may still include other public accounts.
`FMX_RELAY_URL` is optional and defaults to `https://myfirstmate.io`, mainly for developers pointing at a local relay.
For direct client invocations, environment values override `.env`; bootstrap activation still keys off `.env` presence so watcher artifacts are explicit local opt-in state.
`FMX_ENV_FILE` can point direct poll/reply client invocations at another `.env`-style file, but it does not change bootstrap activation.

The locked session-start bootstrap step turns the token into local generated state.
It writes `state/x-watch.check.sh`, a check shim that runs `bin/fm-x-poll.sh`, and `config/x-mode.env`, which exports `FM_CHECK_INTERVAL=30` for watcher processes in that home.
This section is the single owner of the X-mode cadence contract: an X instance polls every 30 seconds instead of the default 300, only an X instance speeds up because a non-X home has no `config/x-mode.env`, and the session-start supervision operating block includes the cadence instruction when that file exists.
The active primary-harness supervision protocol owns how that sourced cadence reaches the watcher process.
Because `bin/fm-watch.sh` reads `FM_CHECK_INTERVAL` only at process start, a cadence transition - opt-in while a watcher is already running, or opt-out - is applied by restarting the home-scoped watcher through the emitted harness protocol; bootstrap deliberately never restarts the watcher itself.
While away mode is active the daemon owns the watcher and its default cadence applies; away-mode X cadence is a deferred follow-up.
When the token is removed or empty, the next locked session-start bootstrap step removes those artifacts.
Steady-state off is silent and writes nothing.
X mode is purely additive: no edit is made to `bin/fm-watch.sh`, `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`, `bin/fm-wake-lib.sh`, or the afk daemon (`bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh` and the `afk` skill).
It lives entirely in X-specific `bin/` scripts, the `fmx-respond` skill, and the generated local artifacts above.

`bin/fm-x-poll.sh` calls `GET /connector/poll` with `Authorization: Bearer <FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN>`.
HTTP 204 is silent.
A pending mention with non-empty `text` is stored at `state/x-inbox/<request_id>.json` and wakes firstmate with `x-mention <request_id>`.
The full relay object is preserved, including `in_reply_to: {author_handle, text}` when the mention is a reply in a conversation or `null` for fresh mentions.
The `fmx-respond` skill decides whether the stashed mention is an actionable request, a question, or a pure acknowledgment.
Actionable reversible requests are run through intake, backlog, dispatch, investigation, or ship flow as appropriate.
If the work completes in that turn, the public reply reports the outcome.
If the request spawns a longer-running task, firstmate posts an acknowledgement through the normal answer endpoint, links the task to the mention with `bin/fm-x-link.sh`, and posts up to three completion follow-ups on genuine milestones, always finishing with a `--final` one when the task reaches a terminal state.
That link stores optional reply-platform context so Discord-originated follow-ups keep Discord's larger message budget after the inbox file has been drained.
Platform resolution has an ordering-safe fallback: `bin/fm-x-link.sh` first reads the context from the still-present inbox payload, and for a fresh link that finds none it asks the relay authoritatively by request_id via `POST /connector/request-context` (`{request_id}` in, `{platform, reply_max_chars}` back), so a link recorded after the ack reply drained the inbox can still learn the right split budget when the relay resolves it.
`bin/fm-x-link.sh` requires `jq` to parse and record context, while its request-context lookup is best-effort: no token or `curl`; a non-2xx response; an unresolved response; or a relay version without that endpoint leaves the context unknown.
In that case the link is still recorded but `bin/fm-x-link.sh` prints a loud warning rather than silently defaulting follow-ups to the X 280-char budget.
Fresh links start with `x_followups=0` and the current timestamp; when relinking the same relay request onto a successor task, pass paired `--carry-count <n> --carry-ts <epoch>` flags plus any prior `x_platform=` and `x_reply_max_chars=` as `--carry-platform <x|discord> --carry-max <n>` so the successor preserves the already-consumed follow-up count, original 7-day window, and reply split budget.
Pure acknowledgments or mentions with nothing to answer are dismissed through `bin/fm-x-dismiss.sh` before the local inbox file is cleared.
Dismiss sends `POST /connector/dismiss` with `{request_id}`, posts no text, and tells the relay to drop the request instead of re-offering it or falling back to an offline auto-reply.
Relay auth or config problems are reported once as `x-mode-error ...` until recovery.
Live replies are posted by `bin/fm-x-reply.sh`, which sends `POST /connector/answer` with `{request_id,text}` for one-message replies.
Add `--image <path>` to attach one local PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, or TIFF as `{media_type,data_base64}` in the relay's optional `image` object.
Completion follow-ups use `bin/fm-x-followup.sh`, which checks the local `state/<id>.meta` link and sends the same payload shape through `POST /connector/followup` by calling `bin/fm-x-reply.sh --followup`, up to three times per link within the window.
Add `--image <path>` there too when a completion follow-up should carry an image.
A successful post increments the local `x_followups=` counter and keeps the link, unless `--final` was passed or the new count reaches the cap, in which case the link is cleared instead; a failed post leaves the link and counter untouched so it can be retried.
The relay itself rejects a follow-up past its own cap or window with HTTP 409 and may include `{"error":"followup_unavailable"}` in the response body; the client surfaces any follow-up 409 as a distinguishable exit code and uses the body marker only for a sharper diagnostic.
`fm-x-followup.sh` treats that exit exactly like a locally-detected expiry - clearing the link and skipping quietly rather than retrying - so an older single-follow-up relay or an already-exhausted binding degrades gracefully.
Past-window relay rejections are only guaranteed while the expired binding row still exists on the relay side; after its cleanup sweep, a very-late follow-up call may instead see a benign no-op 200, which is why the local window and cap pruning remains the primary guard.
Reply splitting is platform-aware: an explicit relay platform field (`reply_platform`, `platform`, `target_platform`, `source_platform`, or `provider`) wins, otherwise a legacy `tweet_id` beginning with `discord:` selects Discord and a numeric `tweet_id` selects X.
An explicit relay limit field (`reply_max_chars`, `reply_max_characters`, `message_max_chars`, `message_limit`, or `max_chars`) wins over the platform defaults.
If the reply exceeds the selected budget, the client splits it into a numbered thread on fenced-code, paragraph, line, and word boundaries and sends `{request_id,text,texts}`, where `texts` is the ordered chunk list and `text` remains the first chunk for older relays.
When `--image <path>` is present on a split reply, the image rides the first/opener message and later chunks stay text-only.
`FMX_X_REPLY_MAX_CHARS` defaults to 280 and clamps to a minimum of 50; `FMX_DISCORD_REPLY_MAX_CHARS` defaults to 1900, clamps to a minimum of 50, and resets values above Discord's 2000-character limit back to 1900.
`FMX_X_THREAD_MAX` defaults to 25 and caps oversized reply threads for every platform, marking the last retained message with an ellipsis when truncation is needed.
`FMX_FOLLOWUP_MAX_AGE_SECS` defaults to 604800 (7 days) and controls the local completion follow-up window; `FMX_FOLLOWUP_MAX_COUNT` defaults to 3 and controls the local follow-up cap.

Set `FMX_DRY_RUN` to preview replies and dismissals without posting.
Truthy means anything except unset, empty, `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off`; an explicit environment value wins over `.env`.
In dry-run, `fm-x-reply.sh` records the would-be payload to `state/x-outbox/<request_id>.json`, including `texts` for a thread and an `endpoint` marker for follow-up previews, prints a `DRY RUN` summary to stderr, echoes the `request_id`, and exits 0.
When an image is attached, the dry-run record uses compact `{media_type, bytes, source_path}` metadata instead of writing the base64 bytes.
In dry-run, `fm-x-dismiss.sh` records `{request_id, endpoint:"dismiss"}` to the same outbox path, prints a `DRY RUN` summary, echoes the `request_id`, and exits 0.
The live answer and follow-up bodies intentionally stay the same shape, including optional `image`; the relay distinguishes them by endpoint, and dismiss stays `{request_id}`.
These paths need `jq` to build the JSON payload, but they run before token and network checks, so they need neither `FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN` nor `curl`.

```

`fm-teardown.sh` retries only Git's `Unable to create '...index.lock': File exists` return failure up to `FM_TREEHOUSE_RETURN_LOCK_RETRIES` times.
`FM_TREEHOUSE_RETURN_LOCK_RETRIES` accepts a nonnegative integer, and an unset, blank, or invalid value uses the default of 3.
`FM_TREEHOUSE_RETURN_LOCK_RETRY_WAIT_SECS` accepts nonnegative whole or fractional seconds between attempts.
When it is unset or blank, `FM_STALE_WORKTREE_LOCK_RETRY_WAIT_SECS` remains a compatible fallback, and a blank fallback uses the 1-second default.
An invalid nonblank wait falls back to 1 second rather than interrupting teardown.
Teardown never removes a lock during the retry window, and after that window it attempts stale-lock cleanup only for a still-present lock that passes the configured age and live-holder checks.

`fm-fleet-sync.sh` applies the same shape to an orphaned `.git/packed-refs.lock`: it retries only Git's `Unable to create '...packed-refs.lock': File exists` fetch failure up to `FM_FLEET_SYNC_PACKED_REFS_LOCK_RETRIES` times (nonnegative integer; unset, blank, or invalid uses the default of 3), waiting `FM_FLEET_SYNC_PACKED_REFS_LOCK_RETRY_WAIT_SECS` seconds (nonnegative whole or fractional; invalid falls back to 1 second) before each.
Only after those retries exhaust does it remove the lock, and only when it is provably stale - still present, mtime age at least `FM_FLEET_SYNC_PACKED_REFS_LOCK_AGE_SECS` (default 30), and no `lsof` holder of the lock file or of the clone worktree itself (a live `git` keeps that as its cwd even in the window after it closes the lock and before it exits).
A live lock, a missing `lsof`, any failed check, or any other fetch failure keeps today's behavior.
Every wait, retry, and removal is printed to stderr, and a successful recovery also prints one `recovered:` summary line to stdout so a session-start refresh - which discards fleet-sync stderr and relays only stdout - still surfaces it.
The shared staleness proof lives in `bin/fm-lock-lib.sh`, which both `fm-teardown.sh` and `fm-fleet-sync.sh` use.
