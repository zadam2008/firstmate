## What it is

You can run one coding agent easily.
But the moment you want three project tasks done in parallel - fixes, investigations, plans, audits - you become a tab-juggler: babysitting sessions, copy-pasting context between repos, forgetting which terminal had the failing test.

firstmate flips the model.
You talk to a single agent - the first mate - and it runs the crew for you: spawning autonomous agents in a visible session backend, giving each a clean git worktree, supervising them to completion, and handing you finished PRs, approved local merges, or standalone investigation reports.
For larger fleets, you can opt in to persistent secondmates: domain supervisors that are still ordinary direct reports, but run from their own isolated firstmate homes.
There is no app to install; the orchestrator is `AGENTS.md`, bundled firstmate skills, and helper scripts that any terminal coding agent can follow.

This is not an agent harness. This is not a single skill. This is not a CLI.
This is.. a directory that turns any agent into your firstmate, and you the captain.

## Features

- **One liaison** - you talk only to the first mate; it dispatches, supervises, escalates only real decisions, and reports plain outcomes.
- **A visible crew** - every crewmate works in its own tmux window, experimental herdr/zellij tab, cmux workspace, or Orca terminal you can watch or type into; the first mate reconciles.
- **Disposable worktrees** - each task runs in a clean [treehouse](https://github.com/kunchenguid/treehouse) git worktree, or an Orca-managed worktree when `backend=orca`, so parallel work on one repo never collides.
- **Two task shapes** - ship tasks deliver a change; scout tasks investigate, plan, reproduce, or audit and leave a report.
- **Explicit project modes** - each project ships via `no-mistakes`, `direct-PR`, or `local-only`, with an optional `+yolo` autonomy flag.
- **Optional secondmates** - opt in to persistent domain supervisors that run from isolated firstmate homes with their own `FM_HOME`, state, projects, and session lock, kept on the primary firstmate version by guarded local fast-forwards and checked for live agent processes at session start.
- **Event-driven, zero-token supervision** - a bash watcher sleeps on the fleet and wakes the first mate only when something needs you; verified primary harnesses also get a turn-end backstop that blocks or follows up on a blind stop when work is in flight and supervision is not live.
- **Optional X mode** - opt in with one local `.env` token so firstmate can answer your public `@myfirstmate` mentions, act on normal reversible mention requests through the same lifecycle as chat requests, acknowledge spawned work, and post up to three public-safe completion follow-ups within seven days for genuine milestones and the final outcome without changing non-X behavior; dry-run preview records would-be replies and dismissals locally before go-live.
- **Guarded by construction** - the first mate is read-only over your projects outside guarded clone refreshes, safe branch pruning, and approved `local-only` fast-forward merges; crewmates make every project change behind your merge approval.
- **Restart-proof** - all state lives on disk and in the active session backend (tmux by hard default, herdr or cmux when selected or auto-detected, zellij/orca when explicitly selected); kill the session anytime and the next one reconciles, including confirmed-dead secondmate agents, and carries on.

Full detail on every feature lives in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** a verified agent harness (claude, codex, opencode, pi, or grok), git with GitHub auth, and tmux for the reference session backend.
The first mate detects and offers to install everything else.
For the best firstmate experience, run the primary firstmate session in Claude Code if you have an Anthropic subscription: its background task and Stop-hook behavior match firstmate's lowest-friction supervision model.
If Claude Code is not available, use Pi next; it has the best non-Anthropic primary-session ergonomics verified so far.
Codex, OpenCode, and Grok remain supported verified harnesses, but their supervision paths involve more harness-specific tradeoffs.

```sh
gh auth login
git clone https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate
cd firstmate && claude   # launch your harness here; AGENTS.md takes over
```

Then just talk:

```sh
> ahoy! look at my github project xyz, then fix the flaky login test and add dark mode

# firstmate checks its toolchain (asking your consent before installing anything),
# clones the project under projects/, and spawns two crewmates in the active backend
# fm-fix-login-k3 and fm-dark-mode-p7.
# Minutes later:

  PR ready for review, captain: https://github.com/you/xyz/pull/42
  (fix flaky login test - risk: low - CI green)

> alright merge it
```

Setup guides for tmux (the default) and every other supported backend (herdr, zellij, Orca, cmux) are linked in [Documentation](#documentation) below.

## How It Works

```

     │
     ├─ ship: project mode ► PR/local merge ► teardown
     │
     └─ scout: report at data/<id>/report.md ► relay findings ► teardown
```

You chat with the first mate.
It routes each request to a crewmate in its own session endpoint and git worktree, supervises the fleet with a zero-token event-driven watcher, and brings you finished PRs, approved local merges, or investigation reports.
Optional secondmates extend this to persistent domain supervisors, dispatch profiles let you steer which harness handles which task, and an opt-in X mode lets the same fleet answer public mentions.
`codex-app` is not a runtime backend yet; [docs/codex-app-backend.md](docs/codex-app-backend.md) owns the Codex App boundary.

Full architecture - the supervision engine, worktree isolation, secondmates, dispatch profiles, project modes, optional X mode, fleet sync, and self-update - is in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Built-in skills

Firstmate ships these user-invocable built-in skills.
Claude and grok use the slash form shown here; codex uses the same names with `$`, such as `$afk`.

| Skill              | What it does                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/afk`             | Enter away-mode supervision: the sub-supervisor self-handles routine wakes in bash and escalates only captain-relevant events as one batched digest, cutting supervision cost while you step away |
| `/bearings`        | Generate a "pick up where I left off" status report from the read-only fleet snapshot - backlog, per-task crew state, open PRs, scout reports, pending decisions, and date-gated queued work - written to a dated file in `data/` and surfaced concisely in chat; read-mostly, mutates no task state |
| `/updatefirstmate` | Self-update the running firstmate and its secondmates to the latest from origin with fast-forward-only pulls, then re-read instructions and nudge secondmates |
| `/stow`            | Sweep the session for uncaptured durable knowledge, route each finding to its disk home per AGENTS.md, file undone next steps to the backlog, and report what is now safe to reset |

Agent-only reference skills live under `.agents/skills/` and are loaded by firstmate at the trigger points named in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

### Two-tier skill layout

Firstmate's skills live in two separate places with different audiences:

- `.agents/skills/` - agent-loaded skills (this section's table, plus firstmate's agent-only reference skills). Every one of these assumes a live firstmate home and is meaningless, or actively misleading, installed anywhere else, so each carries `metadata.internal: true` in its frontmatter. That flag hides them from installer discovery (tools like the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) `npx skills add` installer) without affecting how firstmate itself loads them - frontmatter metadata is inert to the agent's own skill loader.
- `skills/` - public, installer-facing skills meant to be installed standalone into any project, independent of firstmate.
  Each one is a self-contained skill with no dependency on firstmate's paths, tools, or vocabulary.
  Today that is `skills/stow`, a generic session-knowledge-sweep skill that routes findings by explicit instruction first, then existing local conventions, then a private `.stow-notes.md` fallback in the current directory, and closes with a resume pointer for the next session.
  It intentionally shares no code with the firstmate-internal `.agents/skills/stow` it is named after, so the two can evolve independently.
