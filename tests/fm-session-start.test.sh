# tests/fm-session-start.test.sh - behavior tests for bin/fm-session-start.sh,
# the single command that collapses AGENTS.md sections 3 (bootstrap) and 5
# (recovery) into one ordered digest.
#
# Coverage:
#   - absent-file markers vs empty-but-present files in the context digest
#   - the lock-refusal read-only path: banner leads, every mutating step is
#     skipped (including bootstrap's four mutating sweeps, verified by their
#     ABSENCE), the digest still completes
#   - output section ordering: diagnostics/banners lead, bulk file dumps follow
#   - context-aware next-step guidance for read-only, AFK, X mode, and normal
#     watcher ownership
#   - status-tail bounding, default and FM_SESSION_START_STATUS_TAIL override
#   - orphan status logs whose task meta has already disappeared
#   - per-task endpoint-liveness lines for a live and a dead recorded target,
#     tmux and herdr both
#   - composition: the script invokes the real fm-lock.sh/fm-bootstrap.sh/
#     fm-wake-drain.sh (their real, distinctive output appears verbatim), it
#     does not reimplement their logic
